                Hello my name is Andrew Kim, 
                I grew up on the Makah Reservation. I moved to Seattle 
                in 2016 and attended North Seattle College's CS course 
                through CS 142. Outside of school I spent the busy seasons 
                helping with my parents' seafood business filling 
                various roles from purchasing and processing to reporting 
                fish tickets to Fish and Wildlife. My biggest role 
                when I wasn't helping with the paperwork was grading the fish 
                as it was being packaged to be shipped out to our customers. 
                My current goal is to reach a point where I am ready to start 
                interviewing for software development positions.
