                Hello my name is Andrew Kim, 
                I grew up on the Makah Reservation. I moved to Seattle 
                in 2016 and attended North Seattle College's CS course 
                through CS 142. Outside of school I spent the busy seasons 
                helping with my parents' seafood business filling 
                various roles from purchasing and processing to reporting 
                fish tickets. My biggest role when I wasn't helping with the 
                paperwork was grading the fish as it was being packaged to 
                be shipped out to our customers. 
                If I've learned one thing from my experience in QA, it would 
                be the importance of understanding the end consumers needs. 
                The only opinion that matters about the quality of a product 
                is the client's, so it is imperitive to check-in from time to
                time to ensure that a project is coming along to spec. 
                My current goal is to reach a point in technical ability to 
                where I can start applying the skills I've already learned 
                in a software development setting.
